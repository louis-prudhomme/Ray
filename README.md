## Usage

1. Import the framework into the class: `import IBANValidator`
2. Test the IBAN:

```
let validIBAN = "AL90208110080000001039531801"

do {
    
    let _ = try IBANValidator(iban: validIBAN)
    
    // Validation was successful, carry on
    
} catch let error as IBANValidationError {
    
    // Handle error
    print(error)
    
} catch {
    
    // Something else went wrong
    
}
```

## Validation errors

Errors are returned as an `IBANValidationError`:

```
public enum IBANValidationError: String, LocalizedError {
    case invalidChecksum = "Invalid checksum"
    case invalidCountryCode = "Invalid country code"
    case invalidLength = "Invalid length"
    case invalidCharacters = "Invalid characters"
}
```
